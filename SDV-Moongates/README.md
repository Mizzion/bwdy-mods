#### Moongates are magical portals that have opened around Stardew Valley. Nobody knows what spurred their recurrence, or what drives them. But every night, while the moon is high, they change, and every day you will find them in different locations. They may offer a shortcut, early access to a new area, or simply a prompt to explore an area you might not otherwise have gone.

# Features

* Multiplayer Compatible!
* Pairs of connected Moongates now appear randomly around Stardew Valley.
* They move every night, so keep an eye out for them!
