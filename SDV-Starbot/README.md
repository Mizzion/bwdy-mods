#### Starbot is a Stardew Valley bot, installed like any other mod.  Not for any particular purpose, just to live and do its thing; its objectives will vary based on conditions and a few other variables. It's also multiplayer compatible, you could use it to operate farmhands while being the only human player present.  Or to keep working while you take a break, assuming you don't mind it wandering off to do something entirely different.

#### More can be added to Starbot in time.  As of now, its objectives are fairly mundane.  But it's designed in a way that expanding its behaviors is straightforward, and hopefully we will do just that.  In this early build, the bot will likely give up if it gets dragged into a cutscene, or if it gets boxed in somewhere without a path home.  Or if Marnie threatens it with a pet adoption offer. 

# Features

* Easily toggled via hotkey (Shift + B)
* Will forage, clear debris from the farm, and put itself to sleep if it gets bored or runs out of work to do in a day.
